# Image classification with gan based data augmentation

Data scarcity can be the biggest limiting factor for achieving a good classification accuracy in machine learning problems. Here, we are trying to overcome this limitation by creating synthetic data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We train GANs with COVID-19 Chest CT Scan Dataset to investigate the effect of using GAN-generated images as a data augmentation technique. We use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict whether the patient has been infected by COVID-19. We got 80% test accuracy for the ResNet and VGG models with transfer learning with our augmented data which created by our GAN.

It was our computer vision project. You can view our gan and cnn structures in ipynb format. You can see our report in the pdf file.
